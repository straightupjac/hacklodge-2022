How to integrate a LegacyXYZ guestbook into your website
</Callout>
1. First, register your website/project on [legacy-xyz](https://legacy-xyz.vercel.app/install) and submit your project information.
2. Once you've successfully registered your project, install our npm package
  ```
  yarn add legacy-xyz
  ```
  or
  ```
  npm install legacy-xyz
  ```

  `legacy-xyz` includes with 2 components: `SignLegacy` prompts users to sign and, `SignersList` displays all the signatures of everyone who's visited your site).

3. To import the components:
  ```js
  import {SignLegacy, SignersList} from 'legacy-xyz';

  export function default YourApp() {
    return (
      <SignLegacy projectId="legacyxyz" />
      <SignersList projectId="legacyxyz" />
    )
  }
  ```
In V2, we plan to integrate a social graph so that your project can be discoverable by other signers across the internet.
